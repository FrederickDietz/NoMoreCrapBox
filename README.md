I'm not paying 5$ to google so you'll have to enable dev mode in Brave and install it as unpacked from brave://extensions/

I feel like I never explained this very well, if you've ever watched a youtube video with a clarify box below the video, this script got rid of that. 
but I cancelled it. why?

Github locks developers out of their accounts, demands phone numbers and other data from them to get back in, and uses developers public/private repos to train LLMs. This is enough reason for me to leave the platform.

I won't support microsoft, I won't support the elimination of privacy, I won't give them free code anymore just so they can stab me in the back, and I hope they go belly up some day.

fuck micrococks, i'm out peace.
